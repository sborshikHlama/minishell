# minishell

## Todo

### Structure
- [ ] update libft to build those files;

### Lexer
### Parser
- [ ] parse tokens into a strucutre called smth like command;
- [ ] handle validation while parsing;

### Expander
- [ ] Provide functionality to buitlins export and unset commands
### Executor
- [ ] Finish builtins
- [ ] Handle signals

## Notes

- [ ] Maybe we need to create a structure to prevent using too much global variables
- [ ] Write some tests for parser 

### Output and actions

- Probably it would be better to use write function as it directly writes into the output.
